This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### About the Project
This project offers a basic template for an e-commerce website. Users can view products, add them to their carts, mark favorite items, and perform more actions. Additionally, administrators can manage products and add new ones.

### Technologies and Tools Used:

* `React.js:` We utilized the React library to build the user interface. React's component-based architecture made the project more modular.
* `Styled Components:` Styled Components were used for styling. This approach, which combines styles and components, provided a more readable and maintainable codebase.
* `React Icons:` We integrated icons on the page using the React Icons library. This library facilitated the easy integration of various icons.
* `JSON Data:` JSON-formatted data was used to store product information. This allowed us to manage data easily and quickly prototype the project in its initial stages.

### Details and Features:

* Products: Product information stored in a JSON file can be dynamically displayed on the page. Users can also add products to their favorites and continue shopping by adding them to their carts.
* Responsive Design: The project is designed to adapt to different screen sizes. Thus, it can be comfortably used on both desktop and mobile devices.
* Admin Panel: Admin users can manage products and add new ones through a dedicated admin panel.
